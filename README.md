# ETSRP For Euro Truck Simulator 2

**ETSRP is made with [pypresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence). All the credit goes to the devs**

## Usage

To use BetterRP, just download a .zip clone of the repo and start the `etsrp.exe` file in the `dist` folder. Don't worry, it has no viruses.

For a detailed RP in your Discord Profile, download the [ETS2 Telemetry Server](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server#installation) and run it while etsrp is running

## WARNING

**To use the telemetry server with ETSRP, `VMware Network Adapter VMnet8` **MUST** be selected as Network Interfaces. If `VMware Network Adapter VMnet8` doesn't exist, select `Wifi` or `Ethernet`. It depends on what you are using for internet connection.**
